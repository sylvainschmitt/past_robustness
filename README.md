This is the repo for the paper *Paleorecords reveal biological mechanisms crucial for reliable species range shift projections amid rapid climate change*, available here: [url]

- `scripts` folder contains all the code used in this study (paleoclimate data generation, migration simulations...)
- `data` folder contains all the simulation outputs, as well as the climatic hypervolumes and climatic similarity metrics
- `manuscript` folder contains all the scripts to run the (simple) statistical analysis, make the figures as well as the latest Latex files
  
You can test it by rendering the document in `manuscript/figures.Rmd`, e.g. `using markdown::render`.

(Thanks to S. Schimtt for verifying the reproducibility of the analyses and figures, and for suggesting several improvements)
